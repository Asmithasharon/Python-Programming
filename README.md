# Python-Programming
# sum_of_digits.py => program to find the sum of the digits of the given number.
# reverse_digit.py => program to reverse the digits of the entered number.
# palindrome.py => program to check whether the given number remains the same even after it is reversed.
# gcd.py => program to find gcd(greatest common divisor) of two numbers using Euclid algorithm.
# square_root.py => program to find the square root of a number using Newton's method of finding square root.
# fermat_thrm.py => Fermatâ€™s Theorem says that there are no positive integers a, b, and c such that a^n + b^n = c^n for any values of n greater than 2. This program is to prove 
                     whether fermat is right or wrong.
